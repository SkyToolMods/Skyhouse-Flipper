How to download and setup:
1. Use with forge 1.8.9 and put it into your mods folder
2. Load minecraft - head to skyblock and type /skyhouselogin
3. This will send you to a discord server, where upon agreeing to the rules you can go to #skyhouse-support or #bot-commands and type the command -token
4. This will send a command to paste into your minecraft chat. Once used, you will recieve a message "Successfully set token" and you can start using the mod
5. Type /sh to start
6. I would turn on everything in AH Overlays and Price Overlays although it is personal choice.
7. Once done with that - head into AH Overlays then click Edit GUI position and drag around to move - +/- to change the size
8. Save and exit - next time you open the AH house, you will be set.
9. If you are having any issues, you can head over to the Skyhouse server - https://discord.gg/bnAczXhMj8
